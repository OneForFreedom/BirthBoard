This isn't an actual BOM since I'm not gonna make it. But here are some things that you really need for the keyboard to work.


1. Raspberry Pi PICO
2. Switches 70+
3. Keycap set (id prefer getting 4 different coloured ones so that you can add random coloured ones to act as "sprinkles")
4. pcb (no comment)
5. The case
6. Oled display 128x64
7. The plate.
8. Felt pads (trust me you'll need this)
9. Diodes
10. Stabs (warning. pcb doesnt have stab holes, you'll have to make them yourself.)
11. Screws

    P.S There are other bits and bobs you can buy to make your keyboard more flashy, like a pink usb cable or whatever. You could even go for some rubber o-rings. But those are extravagances. If you want a working keyboard, those are what you need ^^^

    If you want to buy them, ali express got you covered 100%
